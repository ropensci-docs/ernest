# Generate new points with slice sampling

Create new samples for the live set by evolving a current point in the
set through slice sampling within a bounding hyperrectangle, shrinking
the rectangle when proposals are rejected.

## Usage

``` r
slice_rectangle(enlarge = NA)
```

## Arguments

- enlarge:

  `[double(1)]`  
  Factor by which to inflate the hyperrectangle's volume before sampling
  (see Details). Optional, and must be greater or equal to 1 if
  provided; if left `NA`, sampling is initially bounded by the unit
  hypercube at each iteration.

## Value

`[slice_rectangle]`, a named list that inherits from
\[[ernest_lrps](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/new_ernest_lrps.md)\].

## Details

The slice LRPS generates proposals by uniformly sampling within a
bounding hyperrectangle that contains regions of the parameter space
satisfying the likelihood criterion. Sampling begins by selecting a
known live point \\\theta\\ that satisfies the criterion. Each iteration
proposes a new point within this rectangle via uniform sampling and
compares it against the criterion; if rejected, a new hyperrectangle is
drawn such that the proposed point is on its boundary and \\\theta\\ is
in its interior. This continues until either a valid proposal is found
or the rectangle has shrunk to the point where no further clamping
operations can be performed.

By default, the hyperrectangle spans the extreme values of the current
live set in each dimension. This may risk excluding valid regions of the
parameter space, particularly where the posterior is multimodal or
highly non-Gaussian. To mitigate this, set `enlarge > 1`, which inflates
the hyperrectagle's volume by the specified factor before sampling.
Setting `enlarge` to `NA` disables this behaviour, instead slicing from
the unit hypercube at each iteration.
