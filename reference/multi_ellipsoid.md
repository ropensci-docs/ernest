# Generate new points from multiple spanning ellipsoids

Partitions the prior space into a set of ellipsoids whose union bounds
the live set. New points are created by randomly selecting an ellipsoid
(weighted by their respective volumes), then using it to generate a
random point as in
[unif_ellipsoid](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/unif_ellipsoid.md).
Effective for multimodal posteriors where a single ellipsoid would be
inefficient.

## Usage

``` r
multi_ellipsoid(enlarge = 1.25)
```

## Arguments

- enlarge:

  `[double(1)]`  
  Factor by which to inflate the bounding ellipsoid's volume before
  sampling (see Details). Must be at least 1.0.

## Value

`[multi_ellipsoid]`, a named list that inherits from
\[[ernest_lrps](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/new_ernest_lrps.md)\].

## Details

Nested likelihood contours for multimodal distributions are poorly
represented by a single ellipsoid. This method fits multiple ellipsoids
to better capture disconnected or elongated regions.

Ellipsoids are generated using the following procedure:

1.  A single ellipsoid is fit to the live set, with volume \\V\\.

2.  The live set is clustered into two groups using k-means clustering.

3.  Ellipsoids are fit to each cluster.

4.  The split ellipsoids are accepted if both ellipsoids are
    non-degenerate, and if the combined volume of the split ellipsoids
    is significantly smaller than the original ellipsoid (calculated
    using Bayes' Information Criterion).

5.  Steps 2–4 are repeated recursively on each new ellipsoid until no
    further splits are accepted, updating \\V\\ to the volume of the
    currently split ellipsoid.
