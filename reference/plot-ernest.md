# Plot diagnostics from nested sampling results

Visualizes key diagnostics from nested sampling outputs as functions of
log-prior volume.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'ernest_estimate'
plot(x, which = c("evidence", "weight", "likelihood"), n = 512, ...)

# S3 method for class 'ernest_run'
plot(x, which = c("evidence", "weight", "likelihood"), n = 512, ...)

# S3 method for class 'ernest_estimate'
summary(
  object,
  which = c("evidence", "weight", "likelihood"),
  n = 512,
  width = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x, object:

  \[[ernest_run](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/generate-ernest.md)\]
  or
  \[[ernest_estimate](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/calculate.ernest_run.md)\]  
  An object containing results from nested sampling.

- which:

  `[character()]`  
  One or more diagnostics to display. Must be any of `"evidence"`,
  `"weight"`, and `"likelihood"`.

- n:

  `[integer(1)]`  
  Number of evaluation points along the log-volume axis used to
  summarize each curve.

- ...:

  These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.

- width:

  `[numeric()]`  
  Numeric vector of widths for uncertainty intervals. Defaults to the
  50%, 80%, and 95% highest mean depth intervals.

## Value

For `plot`, the `ggplot` object, invisibly. It is also printed as a side
effect. For `summary`, a `list` with possible elements `evidence`,
`weight`, and `likelihood`. Each element is a data frame.

## Details

[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) is a
visualization wrapper around `summary.ernest_estimate()`, followed by
`autoplot()`. Use `which` to select diagnostics:

- `which = "evidence"`: Estimated marginal likelihood as a function of
  log-prior volume.

- `which = "weight"`: Posterior mass concentration across log-prior
  volume.

- `which = "likelihood"`: Normalized likelihood across log-prior volume.

If `x` is an `ernest_run`, plotting first computes
`calculate(x, ndraws = 0)`. In this mode, `log_volume` and `log_weight`
are deterministic, and evidence uncertainty comes from the analytical
normal approximation generated from the original sampling run.

If `x` is an `ernest_estimate` generated with `ndraws > 0`, diagnostics
are summarized over simulated log-volume trajectories. For these
simulated estimates, uncertainty bands for `evidence` and `weight` are
computed as interval summaries on interpolated curves.

To get the underlying data frames used for plotting, use
`summary.ernest_estimate()`. This is useful when you want full control
over plotting.

## Note

Plotting multiple diagnostics with `which` requires
[patchwork](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=patchwork). Plotting
`evidence` or `weight` diagnostics requires
[ggdist](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggdist).

# Plot diagnostics from a run (analytical uncertainty for evidence).
data(example_run)
plot(example_run)

# \donttest{
# Plot diagnostics from simulated log-volume trajectories.
set.seed(123)
est <- calculate(example_run, ndraws = 100)
plot(est)

# }
