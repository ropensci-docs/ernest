# Generate new points from the spanning ellipsoid

Uses the bounding ellipsoid of the live set to define the region of
prior space that contains new points. Effective for unimodal and
roughly-Gaussian posteriors.

## Usage

``` r
unif_ellipsoid(enlarge = 1.25)
```

## Arguments

- enlarge:

  `[double(1)]`  
  Factor by which to inflate the bounding ellipsoid's volume before
  sampling (see Details). Must be at least 1.0.

## Value

`[unif_ellipsoid]`, a named list that inherits from
\[[ernest_lrps](https://docs.ropensci.org/ernest/reference/new_ernest_lrps.md)\].

## Details

Nested likelihood contours rarely form perfect ellipses, so sampling
from the spanning ellipsoid without enlargement may exclude valid
regions. This can bias proposals towards the ellipsoid centre and
overestimate evidence. Setting `enlarge = 1` will produce a warning.

The covariance matrix of the points is used to estimate the ellipsoid's
shape. In exceptional cases (e.g., perfect collinearity), this matrix
may be singular. Should this occur, the covariance matrix is
reconditioned by adjusting its eigenvalues. Should this also fail, the
algorithm falls back to sampling from the circumscribed sphere bounding
the unit hypercube.

## Ellipsoids

Ellipsoids are stored in the `cache` environment of the LRPS object.
Ellipsoids are defined by their centre \\c\\ and shape matrix \\A\\. The
set of points \\x\\ contained within the ellipsoid is given by \$\$ x
\in {\bf{R}}^n \| (x-c) A (x-c)' \leq 1 \$\$

The volume of the ellipsoid is \\V = \mathrm{Vol}(S_n)
\sqrt{\det(A^{-1})}\\, where \\\mathrm{Vol}(S_n)\\ is the volume of the
unit hypersphere.

For sampling, we store the matrix \\A^{-1/2}\\, the inverse of the
positive-semidefinite square root of \\A\\. The ellipsoid can
equivalently be defined as the set of points \$\$x = A^{-1/2} y + c,\$\$
where \\y\\ are points from the unit hypersphere.
